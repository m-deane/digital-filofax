    "Markets are fundamentally uncertain. Traditional statistical methods often assume we have unlimited data and that parameters are fixed constants waiting to be discovered. But in commodities trading:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Regimes change**: The dynamics of crude oil in 2020 are different from 2010\n",
    "- **Data is limited**: We may only have 50 years of wheat prices, but wheat has been traded for millennia\n",
    "- **Uncertainty matters**: A forecast of \"$80/barrel\" is useless without knowing how confident we are\n",
    "- **Prior knowledge exists**: Expert traders have beliefs about seasonality, mean reversion, and supply/demand\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayesian methods let us:\n",
    "- **Quantify uncertainty** in every prediction\n",
    "- **Incorporate domain expertise** through prior distributions\n",
    "- **Update beliefs systematically** as new data arrives\n",
    "- **Make decisions** that account for model uncertainty\n",

    "### 1.1 Frequentist View\n",
    "\n",
    "In the **frequentist** view, probability represents the long-run frequency of events:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"There's a 60% chance of rain\" means \"In similar atmospheric conditions, it rains 60% of the time\"\n",
    "- Parameters (like true average return) are **fixed but unknown constants**\n",
    "- Data are random samples from a population\n",
    "- We use data to estimate the fixed parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "**The problem for trading**: We can't repeat the 2008 financial crisis. Each market event is unique. What does \"probability of a recession\" mean in frequentist terms?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Bayesian View\n",
    "\n",
    "In the **Bayesian** view, probability represents our **degree of belief**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"There's a 60% chance of rain\" means \"Given my current information, I believe there's a 60% chance of rain\"\n",
    "- Parameters are **random variables** with probability distributions\n",
    "- We start with **prior beliefs** and update them with data\n",
    "- The result is a **posterior distribution** reflecting updated beliefs\n",
    "\n",
    "**The advantage for trading**: We can talk about \"the probability that crude oil will exceed $100\" even though this specific future hasn't happened yet."
